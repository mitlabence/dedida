JDK 21 should be used (gradlew script used as follows:
gradlew signingReport for getting keys for Firebase for debugging).
This could be changed in the end by creating the JAVA_HOME environmental variable (for user, not for
system) and setting it to JDK 21 path (C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-21 for me).
This might cause issues elsewhere! A better approach would be (but did not seem to work) to use the
jbr directory (3rd place in https://developer.android.com/build/jdks the list of where the android
studio startup script looks for JVM)

Once printing the keys with gradlew signingReport, copy BOTH SHA1 AND SHA256 keys! So have two keys
for debugging.

The package js is outdated! Not sure which package dragged it in the app. Should be upgraded to
dart:js_interop

WHen setting up firebase, do not try google sign in AND firebase at once. Start with firebase :
https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/flutter/debug-provider
Then one gets the debug key. The gradlew signingReport from above shows the debug SHA1 fingerprint,
this has to be added to the app in the firebase console (the firebase project website). In the
appcheck then, the app has to be registered for the project, I used Play Integrity. Then one can
(must) add a debug key so the development can go on. For this, the
await FirebaseAppCheck.instance.activate(
    androidProvider: AndroidProvider.debug,
    appleProvider: AppleProvider.debug,
  );
 must run, and then in Android Studio (Run tab), something like
D/com.google.firebase.appcheck.debug.internal.DebugAppCheckProvider(30954): Enter this debug secret into the allow list in the Firebase Console for your project: ...
followed by the debug token should appear. This should be copied to the AppCheck debug token.#
After this, the google sign in can be added too.
